# Filtering data using forms and action sequences

While standard Skuid filters provide powerful functionality - there are times when you want more flexibility. This Skuid technique uses fields on one model, with actions to pass values into conditions on a second model.

## Instructions
- Page API:  V2
- Data source: Uses default Salesforce data source
- Design system: None 
- Page XML:  [Copy the XML from this page](Arbitrary_Filters.xml), or save it as an XML file, and upload it as a new page in your Salesforce Org.  

## Notes
- Look at the actions in the "Filters" model. When changes are detected in those fields - the value is passed into a condition on the "Opportunities" model. 

- A branch on those actions handles "blank state." If the value is blank - the condition on the "Opportunities" model is deactivated.
