# Validate Form Data with Client Side Capabilities

Skuid can be used to create very effective and complex data entry forms.  Recently Skuid has added field validation features to its forms.  This allows you to provide feedback to users about data validity before they attempt a save. 

The example below shows a number of examples of this field validation in action.
